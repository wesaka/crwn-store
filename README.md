# CRWN Store

This is a - what started as at least -  simple project.
The objective of the project is for me to learn more about react and all the best practices and patterns that the framework utilizes.

# Dependencies

In this project I'm using:
* React
* styled-components
* Redux
* redux-thunk
* Firebase auth
* Firestore

Was also using sass/scss for styling but decided to adopt styled-components

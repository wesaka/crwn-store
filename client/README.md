# CRWN Store

This is a - what started as at least -  simple project.
The objective of the project is for me to learn more about react and all the best practices and patterns that the framework utilizes.

# 

In this project I'm using:
* React
    * Router
* styled-components
* Redux
    * redux-logger
    * redux-persist
    * redux-thunk
    * redux-saga
* Firebase
    * Auth
    * Firestore

Was also using sass/scss for styling but decided to adopt styled-components
